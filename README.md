# Asterix
Scans web folder for music files and creates a list in php

Plays any mp3 MP3 found in the current directory where this single .php file resides.
Original work of mine using a lot of info of the internet to make a sweet simple script.
Note: correct use of the echo is not established, I mean I'm not sure.
With HTML5 alone ,MP3, MP4, M4A are at present univeral / work on all poplular browsers, ogg works on a few, so does wav. Need javascript to implement it.
